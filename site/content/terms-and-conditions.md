## 1. BOOKING CONFIRMATION & PAYMENT

Course bookings are only confirmed upon receipt of full payment and written confirmation (email) from Coast Resuscitation Group.

Coast Resuscitation Group reserves the right to cancel any scheduled course at any time prior to the course start date due to insufficient enrolments.

During this period, cancellations will receive a full refund.

Requests must be submitted by email to: coastresusgroup@gmail.com.

## 3. CANCELLATION & REFUND POLICY

We understand that circumstances can change. Due to certification requirements, pre-course preparation, and fairness to other waitlisted participants, the following applies after the 24-hour cooling-off period:

**More than 42 days before course:** Full refund minus $75 administration fee.

**42 – 30 days before course:** 50% refund of course fees.

**Less than 30 days before course:** No refund available.
